# Contributing to ChainLink

First, thank you for considering contributing to Smart Contract DB. We value contributions of any size from anyone! The smallest of additions to crypto resources can make the biggest difference.

## Submitting New Resources

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow).

If you have web resources that would benefit the growing crypto community, the best action is to open a pull request with that information on Github (please search for related pull requests first). Pull requests are moderated and prioritized before merging. We actively welcome your submission.

Please follow these steps when submitting a new pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make changes to resources documents in `data/resources`.
3. Ensure your resource was added successfully by running the project.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Submit that pull request!

### Submission Criteria

All pull requests made on Github will be reviewed for the following criteria:

- Completeness - basic information about the resource much be complete based on the type of resource. Required fields are given as part of the type in the file located at `data/resources` (eg.: a new book has a `Book` type with details for its listing).
- Quality - each resource type must be from a reputable source.
